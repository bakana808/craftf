##### a markup language based off of minecraft's color code system that supports all JSON features and some extras

CraftF allows you to easily write formatted chat messages that use JSON features.

The JSON string is formatted according to this Gist: <https://gist.github.com/Dinnerbone/5631634>

You can also output it as a legacy string for use outside of Minecraft players.
Of course, any extra JSON functions won't be carried over.
